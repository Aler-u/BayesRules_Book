# Bayes Rules Book Practice

This repository holds RMarkdown files for the exercises in the book _[Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/)_ by Alicia A. Johnson, Miles Q. Ott and Mine Dogucu.

Only the coding exercises are included such as simulations and every individual exercise includes a bit of explanation and some conceptual clarifications around the code, the overall workflow and development.
For the moment all the explanations are in Spanish, I intend to update the files to include an english explanation as well.
